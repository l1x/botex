## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add botex to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:botex, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure botex is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:botex]]
        end

# botex
